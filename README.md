# Customer Churn Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
This repository contains the code and visualizations for an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of customer churn data. The data was obtained from the Kaggle dataset [link_to_Kaggle_customer_churn_dataset] (replace with the actual link).

## Focus of Analysis:

- Understanding factors contributing to customer churn
- Identifying patterns and trends in customer behavior
- Providing insights for customer retention strategies
## Analysis Techniques:

- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Descriptive statistics
- Data visualization with libraries like pandas and matplotlib
## Requirements:

- Python 3.x
- pandas
- matplotlib (and any other libraries used)
## Running the Notebooks:

- Clone this repository.
- Install the required libraries using pip install -r requirements.txt (if you have a requirements.txt file).
- Open a Jupyter Notebook environment and navigate to the notebooks folder.
- Open and run the Jupyter Notebooks (e.g., Customer_Churn_EDA.ipynb).
## Potential Insights:

This EDA aims to reveal valuable insights for customer retention, such as:

- Characteristics of customers more likely to churn
- Relationships between customer demographics and churn
## Disclaimer:

This code and analysis are provided for educational purposes only. The data and findings may not be representative of all customer churn scenarios.
